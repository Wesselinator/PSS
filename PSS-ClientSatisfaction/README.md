# PSS-ClientSatisfaction

PSS was founded by a small family living in a jungle village.
They started out as a child labour shop as the father had 9 wives with 3 children per wife.
The children were ordered to work everday and fix all the damages around the village.
On one day one child thought enough was enough and left the village.
He work hard to study english and other basic skills. 
He then set his eye on building some sort of solution.
After many years of hard work and dedication het founded Premier Service Solution.
He went back to his village and gathered all his brothers and sisters and took tem with him.
As they salve on in his domain of wrath he makes millions.

You know what they say like father like son.
